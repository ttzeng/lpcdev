artf98905:

There are two different ways to use the UART on the LPC812_MAX board:

Method #1:
UART:	LPC_UART0
PINS:	PIO0_4 (TX) / PIO0_0 (RX)
Output: Arduino connector
Notes:	1) Requires soldering changes to the board.
		2) The UART can still be connected to the Host USB after the hardware has been modified.

Procedure:
1.	Modify the board:
	SJ4:	1) Remove the 0-ohm resistor between TARGET_RX-PIO0_1 and IOEXP_INTR (2)
			2) Place a solder bridge between TARGET_RX-PIO0_1 and TARGET_RX (1)
	SJ1:	1) Remove the 0-ohm resistor between TARGET_TX-PIO0_6 and PIO0_6 (2)
			2) Install a solder bridge between TARGET_TX-PIO0_6 and TARGET_TX (1)

2.	Board connection:
	Connect TX, RX and GND from J2 [Arduino Digital Header] to an FTDI Cable.
	LPC812            FTDI cable
	 GND: J1-4         black
	 RX:  J2-8 (D0)    orange
	 TX:  J2-7 (D1)    yellow

3.	Source code changes:
	Do one of the following:
	1) In the IDE, set "UART_ARDUINO" as a pre-processor define.
	2) in project lib_lpc_boards_8xx, file board.h near line 59, add a define for UART_ARDUINO.

4.	Re-build the code

5.	Connect to the serial port via terminal emulator (TeraTerm, PuTTY, etc.)


Method #2:
UART:	LPC_UART0
PINS:	PIO0_6 (TX) / PIO0_1 (RX)
Output: Host USB connector (J3)
Procedure:
1.	Connect the board to the host.
	This is done by connecting J3 (USB micro connector) to the host.
	A serial port will be enumerated something like "mbed Serial Port (COM3)".

2.	Source code changes:
	Verify in the IDE, that "UART_ARDUINO" is NOT set as a pre-processor define.
	Verify in project lib_lpc_boards_8xx, file board.h near line 59, that UART_ARDUINO is NOT defined

3.	Re-build the code

4.	Connect to the serial port via terminal emulator (TeraTerm, PuTTY, etc.)


For reference, here's the source code from board.c in project lib_lpc_boards_8xx
#ifdef	UART_ARDUINO
	/* Connect the U0_TXD_O and U0_RXD_I signals to port pins: P0.4 (TX), P0.0 (RX) */
	Chip_SWM_DisableFixedPin(SWM_FIXED_ACMP_I1);
	Chip_SWM_MovablePinAssign(SWM_U0_TXD_O, 4);
	Chip_SWM_MovablePinAssign(SWM_U0_RXD_I, 0);
#else
	/* Connect the U0_TXD_O and U0_RXD_I signals to port pins: P0.6 (TX), P0.1 (RX) */
	Chip_SWM_DisableFixedPin(SWM_FIXED_ACMP_I2);
	Chip_SWM_MovablePinAssign(SWM_U0_TXD_O, 6);
	Chip_SWM_MovablePinAssign(SWM_U0_RXD_I, 1);
#endif
