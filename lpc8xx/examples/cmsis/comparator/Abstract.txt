This example uses the ACMP_I1 (COMP_VP) and ACMP_I2 (COMP_VM) inputs to trigger the comparator.
VCOMP_I2 uses P0.1 on the LPCXpresso board as an input.  The other input is connected to a variable resistor.
The red LED (LED2) on the LPCXpresso board will turn on or off depending whether the variable resistor voltage
is higher or lower than P0.1.  Note that P0.1 is normally floating if using the LPCXpresso board by itself, so a
voltage should be applied for an accurate commparison.
