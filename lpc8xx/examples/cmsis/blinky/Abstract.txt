Purpose:
Simple blinky program using the Multi-Rate Timer (MRT) for LPC8xx
Also, switch matrix is used to configure the CLKOUT function 

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.
* Default project target set to Blinky_Release (exectuing from flash)
* Can the run project from RAM by setting project target to Blinky_Debug

Note:
Tested on LPC800 LPCXpresso Board
LPC800 running at 24 MHz

Output:
LEDs connected to port pins PIO0_7, PIO0_16, PI0_17 are toggled
Multi-Rate Timer (MRT) is configured to provide a delay for toggling acitivity
Clkout function is assigned via switch matrix to PIO0_12 to see main clock frequency (24 MHz)
