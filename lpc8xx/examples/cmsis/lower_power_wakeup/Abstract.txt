Purpose:
Low Power Mode example which allows user to put the LPC800 in sleep, deep sleep, power-down, 
and deep power-down modes. Mult-rate Timer (MRT) generates an interrupt to wake-up LPC800.

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.
* Default project target set to PMU_Release (exectuing from flash)
* Can the run project from RAM by setting project target to PMU_Debug

Note:
Tested on LPC800 LPCXpresso Board
LPC800 running at 24 MHz when not in low power modes.

In the pmutest.c file, to configure the low power mode, comment in and out respective functions:
To use sleep mode, comment in PMU_Sleep( MCU_SLEEP, regVal)
To use deep sleep mode, comment in PMU_Sleep( MCU_DEEP_SLEEP, regVal) 
To use power-down mode, comment in PMU_Sleep( MCU_POWER_DOWN, regVal)
To use deep power-down mode, sleep mode,set TEST_DEEPPOWERDOWN  to '1' in lpc8xx_pmu.h file

Default set-up is using sleep mode (main clock = 24 MHz)

Hit reset after programming.
Provide a falling to rise edge pulse on PIO0_1 to run the code

To enter deep power-down mode, make sure PIO0_4 pin is externally pulled high.
Once deep power-down mode is entered, pull PIO0_4 externally low to wake up from the mode.
Also, internal wake-up timer can be enabled in the PMU_INIT function (lpc8xx_pmu.c) as well.

Output:
Multi-rate Timer generates an interrupt to wake-up device after sleep or deep sleep or power-down is entered.
On wake-up from low power modes, PIO0_7 (Red LED) toggles
