Purpose:
Example code to configure WatchDog Timer (WDT) in various modes.
MRT (multi-rate timer) and CLKOUT function via switch matrix are used as well.

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.
* Default project target set to Blinky_Release (exectuing from flash)
* Can the run project from RAM by setting project target to Blinky_Debug

Note:
Tested on LPC800 LPCXpresso Board
LPC800 running at 24 MHz
WatchDog Oscillator (WDOSC) is configured a clock source to WatchDog (WDT)


Output:
LEDs connected to port pins PIO0_7 is toggled when no WDT reset, and PI0_17 is toggled when WDT reset occurs.
Multi-Rate Timer (MRT) is configured to provide a delay for toggling acitivity
CLKOUT function is assigned via switch matrix to PIO0_12 to see WDT OSc frequency (~9.48 kHz)
