History of updates to CMSIS_CORE_LPC8xx
=======================================

13 July 2016
------------
Updated LPC8xx.h and system_LPC8xx.c files, in the CMSIS_CORE_LPC8xx project only (this project) for the lpc812 Example Code Bundle.
(These files are now different from the 18 July 2013 versions noted below.)
1. Changed the defines in system_LPC8xx.c so that the SystemInit function configures the clocking for SystemCoreClock = 30 MHz (12 MHz IRC, clocking PLL to produce 60 MHz MainClk, and AHBCLKDIV = divide-by-2).
2. In LPC8xx.h, changed register names in the UART and SPI structs to match the user manual (CTL and TXCTL, instead of CTRL and TXCTRL).
3. Changed Reserved0[1] to Reserved0[45] in the MRT struct. 

18 July 2013
------------
Updated with ARM Cortex-M0+ CMSIS files as supplied in ARM's
CMSIS 3.20 March 2013 release.

18 March 2013
-------------
Defines in system_LPC8xx.c changed so that clock setup is
done based on IRC rather than XTAL, so as to function with
LPC800-MAX board as well as LPCXpresso812. SystemCoreClock 
thus now defaults to 12MHz.

7 November 2012
---------------
CMSIS library project using ARM Cortex-M0+ CMSIS files as
supplied in ARM's CMSIS 3.01 March 2012 release, together
with device specific files.
